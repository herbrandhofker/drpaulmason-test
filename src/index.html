    <h1>WHERE SCIENCE MEETS MEDICINE</h1>
    <p>One might reasonably assume that modern medicine practice would be soundly based on years of accumulated
        evidence. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In many cases, medical practices do not reflect, and
        sometimes directly contrast with what is shown by hard science. This is particulary so in metabolic medicine,
        spinal pain and nutrition for athletic performance. The end result is that patients often do not recieve the
        best quality care. I always strive to ensure that my practice is solidly evidence based, especially where it
        diverges from current practices

Of course, Dr Mason is equally happy treating both athletes and non athletes.
